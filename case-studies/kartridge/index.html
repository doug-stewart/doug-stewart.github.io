      When we were designing Kartridge, it was pretty common for all game pages
      on a platform to look identical. We wanted our pages to stand out and for
      developers to think of Kartridge as the best place for people to see their
      game.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make that a reality, we focused on making the game pages highly
      customizable and visually engaging. The response was resounding. Game
      producers loved the upload flow, saying it was the easiest and clearest
      they&rsquo;d used. Game developers loved how customizable the pages were
      and how easy it was for them to make their storefronts feel like their
      game&rsquo;s home.
    </p>
    <p>
      My key contributions to this page&mdash;aside from writing all HTML and
      CSS&mdash;were the design of the game pods, the ability to create a color
      palette from uploaded screenshots and to use video as the page&rsquo;s
      background.
    </p>

      While the original Kartridge app was written entirely in EmberJs, the demo
      available below was rewritten in React.
